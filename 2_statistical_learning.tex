a) Better. The model is unlikely to overfit for large dataset and small number of features. \\
b) Worse. Too little data for the given number of features can cause overfitting. \\
c) Better. We want more flexible function to capture the relationship between the predictors and response. \\
d) Worse. More flexible model is more likely to pick up more noise. \\
